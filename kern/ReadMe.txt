STEPS:
======
1. Add the 5 files to your "kern" folder and replace the existing ones
2. Run! results of testing each question will be printed JUST BEFORE the "FOS>" prompt

NOTE:
=====
This is an automatic testing for your code. It's very similar to the one that will be used in evaluation.
So, make sure that you pass these tests before submitting your code to the form... 
If you already submit, kindly test again and if there's any modification in your code, resubmit it before the deadline
